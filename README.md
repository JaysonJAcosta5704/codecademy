The list of all completed courses and projects from Codecademy

Everything inside of All-Certificates is a PDF file showing certificates from Codecademy.

Each folder except the previous contains all the projects based off the name of the Codecademy courses. Inside each folder contains the modules from the course, and inside is each project that has been completed.
